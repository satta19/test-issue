SonarQube is an open-source platform developed by SonarSource for continuous inspection of code quality. Sonar does static code analysis, which provides a detailed report of bugs, code smells, vulnerabilities, code duplications.

It supports 25+ major programming languages through built-in rulesets and can also be extended with various plugins.

**Benefits of SonarQube**

1. **Sustainability** - Reduces complexity, possible vulnerabilities, and code duplications, optimising the life of applications.
2. **Increase productivity** - Reduces the scale, cost of maintenance, and risk of the application; as such, it removes the need to spend more time changing the code
3. **Quality code** - Code quality control is an inseparable part of the process of software development.
4. **Detect Errors** - Detects errors in the code and alerts developers to fix them automatically before submitting them for output.
5. **Increase consistency** - Determines where the code criteria are breached and enhances the quality
6. **Business scaling** - No restriction on the number of projects to be evaluated
7. **Enhance developer skills** - Regular feedback on quality problems helps developers to improve their coding skills
